Part 1: WeatherPy
Visualization of weather in over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator using citypy and OpenWeatherMap API. Scatterplots and linear regressions are used to showcase relationships between latitude and temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. Visualizations show that there is a strong correlation between lattitude and temperature.

Part 2: VacationPy
Heat map visualization for every city from Part 1: WeatherPy, narrowed down to ideal weather conditions with pins containing nearest hotel.
